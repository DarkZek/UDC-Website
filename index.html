        <p>As you might have seen over the past few days, the quality of the server has been going downhill due to the sudden activeness of the owner (Alex_TNT), who started taking action and making decisions that consistently overruled the entire moderation team, which he put in place to help run the server. As a result, many users have begun to complain about his actions, of which many were unwanted. All attempts to operate as a functional group has been met with, I'm the owner, if you don't like it, leave.</p>

        <p>Because of his erratic behavior, we have decided to go our own way and make a new server, where the highest ranking member wonï¿½t dictate how things are done. The server will be run by a council of mods, where each decision is voted on and discussed for the future of the server.</p>

        <p>We would love for you to join us, as a server is nothing without its community. We have a great community that we were proud of and want to continue to grow it!</p>

            <li>Muting and banning people on the sole basis of disagreeing with him. </li>
            <li>Refusing to talk to users (insulting them of being kids), and to the staff.</li>
